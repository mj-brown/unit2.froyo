# unit2.froyo

This repository is for the unit 2 block 15 workshop.  The goal of this workshop was to take a list of froyo flavors that are entered into a prompt by a user and populate the information into an object to track how many times a flavor is input.

I built my for loop and object so that it iterates out and tracks any flavor that is input into the prompt.

A way to optimize this is to move away from a prompt and into a form on the html, this way I can also track who likes which flavors.
